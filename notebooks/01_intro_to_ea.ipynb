This notebook and the others included in your onboarding package will walk you through the DL Python API's available to you and how you can use them to scale analyses and data pipelines. The examples in the following notebooks will be focused on agricultural use cases but can easily be translated to your particular subject of interest."

    "\n",
    "- **Scenes** - [The DL Scenes API](https://docs.descarteslabs.com/guides/scenes.html) allows users to seamlessly access over 100 curated raster data products from the DL Data Catalog. With this API you can filter imagery metadata and pull stacks of imagery with a few lines of code.\n",
    "- **Catalog** - The Catalog is both a [Python API](https://docs.descarteslabs.com/guides/catalog_v2.html) and [a web UI](https://catalog.descarteslabs.com/?/) for exploring and uploading raster data on the DL EA. Integrate your raster data feeds into the DL EA to seamlessly intersect with our curated data products.\n",
    "- **Storage** - DL Storage is a [Python API](https://docs.descarteslabs.com/guides/storage.html) for storing and accessing generic objects and data. Storage is commonly used for storing model weights or parameter files used in pipelines.\n",
    "- **Tasks** - Tasks is a scalable backend, [Python API](https://docs.descarteslabs.com/guides/tasks.html), and [web UI](https://monitor.descarteslabs.com/) to deploy your models and data pipelines on. With Tasks you can run batch processing of your models and data pipelines  over large AOIs and timeframes.\n",

    "We'll be working with each of these API's/services through the next few notebooks."
