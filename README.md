# Enterprise Accelerator Notebooks

The Descartes Labs Enterprise Accelerator (EA) powers globally-scalable raster data analysis. Customers can
quickly prototype and deploy Python-based batch processing pipelines that access Descartes Labs' curated
Raster data products.

Please visit https://mktg.descarteslabs.com/platform for more information about Descartes Labs and to request access.

The notebooks in this repo demonstrate how to use the EA, building from basic concepts and API usage to
creating a simple web application that utilizes EA services. To get started, clone this repository locally
and run through the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

The following notebooks are included:

- **01_intro_to_aws_ea.ipynb**
- **02_exploring_the_api.ipynb**
- **03_models_on_demand.ipynb**
- **04_models_at_scale.ipynb**
